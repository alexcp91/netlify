      <p>Why Netlify?</p>

      <p>I came across Netlify in the same manner, I imagine, as many of your customers: by growing frustrated with the complexity of hosting a website and searching for a new way. Until I learned about the JAMstack, I did not appreciate there was an alternative to Ruby on Rails, Django or the MERN stack. It took some time to understand how and why Netlify was different. But, it wasn't long until my "ah-ha" moment.
      <br>
      <br>
      Netlify has built a fundamentally different way to deliver the modern web. In hindsight, the traditional web architecture, where pages are built for each request, is incredibly complex, insecure and inefficient. I'm a 100% self-taught coder, so I appreciate abstracting complexity in favor of ease-of-use, efficiency and security. With each passing year, the complexity to build a website has only increased. In 2018, I shouldn't have to understand Docker and Kubernetes to launch a fast and secure web application. This is the complexity Netlify elegantly addresses, and that is what excites me about the company. It's the natural evolution to Wordpress. It has the potential to power the world's websites.
      <br>
      <br>
      That's an adventure worth joining.

      <p>Why me?</p>

      I've spent the past two years in venture capital, investing and partnering with early-stage companies typically when they have less than 15 employees and $2 million in revenue. I've had to wear many hats, most often as de-facto Head of Finance for our portfolio companies, helping them gain a granular understanding of their unit economics, hiring needs (and costs), their projection models, and how to define and track relevant KPIs. I've partnered with founders on fundraising, and in aggregate helped our portfolio companies raise over $100 million.
      <br>
      <br>
      Prior my time in venture capital, I worked directly with the President of Jefferies in a strategic planning role. At the time, Jefferies was a publicly-traded financial services company with 3,000 employees and over $2 billion annual revenue. A few relevant experiences include:
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Helping a business unit expand into Europe, which required building the financial model, understanding the regulatory landscape, and hiring the initial team</li>
        <li>Leading joint ventures and M&A for a portfolio company, where I was responsible for structuring and bringing those deals to a close. I worked closely with the portfolio company CEO to build financial models incorporating various growth scenarios, and how to best turn an acquired product into a new business line</li>
        <li>Working with Jefferies' business heads on analyses to better understand their profitability, capital needs, customer segmentation and growth opportunities</li>
      </ul>
      Success in my role required the ability to build relationships across the organization, particularly with senior management, and operate comfortably in a fast-paced, ambiguous environment. I was entrusted to lead major initiatives, and act as a representative of the firm in meetings with new strategic partners.
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm excited at the opportunity to bring my experience to Netlify and help re-invent the web. Thank you for the consideration.
